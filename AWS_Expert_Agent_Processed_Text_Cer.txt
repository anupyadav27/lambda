- Necessary licenses for software and databases used.

## 5) Proposed Solution

### 5.1) Current Architecture
- Not applicable as this is a new application deployment.

### 5.2) Proposed Architecture Details

#### Detailed Description
The proposed architecture leverages multiple AWS services to ensure high availability, security, and scalability. The core components include:     

- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- **EC2 Instances**: Hosts the application servers, configured in an Auto Scaling Group for scalability.
- **RDS**: Provides a managed relational database with Multi-AZ deployment for fault tolerance.
- **S3**: Used for storing static content and backups, with lifecycle policies for cost optimization.
- **CloudWatch**: Monitors application performance and logs, provides alarms for anomalies.
- **IAM**: Manages user access and permissions, ensuring least privilege access.
- **VPC**: Segregates the network into public and private subnets, enhancing security.

#### Component Overview
- **ELB**: Configured with health checks to ensure only healthy instances receive traffic.
- **EC2**: Instances are part of an Auto Scaling Group that scales based on demand.
- **RDS**: Configured with automated backups and Multi-AZ for high availability.
- **S3**: Configured with bucket policies and encryption for data protection.
- **CloudWatch**: Set up with custom metrics and alarms for proactive monitoring.
- **IAM**: Roles created for different access levels, with MFA enforced.
- **VPC**: Configured with security groups and NACLs for network security.

#### High Availability
- **ELB** distributes traffic across multiple AZs.
- **Auto Scaling** ensures new instances are launched in case of failures.
- **RDS Multi-AZ** deployment ensures database availability.

#### Security Integration
- **IAM Roles**: Defined for different access levels.
- **VPC**: Configured with private subnets for application servers.
- **Data Encryption**: Enabled for data at rest (using AWS KMS) and in transit (using SSL/TLS).

#### Scalability
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: Automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
- **RDS Read Replicas**: Can be added to handle read-heavy workloads.

#### Performance Monitoring & Optimization
- **CloudWatch**: Monitors key performance metrics and sets up alarms.
- **Elasticache**: Used for caching frequently accessed data.

#### Deployment Strategy
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Using CloudFormation or Terraform for repeatable deployments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy for automated deployments.
- **Blue/Green Deployment**: Minimizes downtime and reduces risk during updates.

#### Environment Considerations
- **Production vs Non-Production**: Non-production environments will use smaller instance types and fewer resources to optimize costs.
- **Configuration Differences**: Non-production environments will have relaxed security and monitoring configurations for development purposes.
