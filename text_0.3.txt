## 5) Proposed Solution

### 5.1) Current Architecture
- Not applicable as this is a new deployment.

### 5.2) Proposed Architecture Details

#### Detailed Description
The proposed architecture consists of the following components:

- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- **Amazon EC2:** Hosts the application servers.
- **Amazon RDS:** Provides a managed relational database service.
- **Amazon S3:** Stores static content and backups.
- **AWS IAM:** Manages user access and permissions.
- **VPC:** Provides network isolation and security.

#### Component Overview
- **ELB:** Ensures high availability by distributing traffic.
- **EC2:** Scalable compute resources for application logic.
- **RDS:** Managed database with automated backups and Multi-AZ support.
- **S3:** Durable storage for static assets and backups.
- **IAM:** Fine-grained access control for users and services.
- **VPC:** Network segmentation with public and private subnets.

#### High Availability
- **ELB:** Distributes traffic across multiple AZs.
- **EC2 Auto Scaling:** Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand.
- **RDS Multi-AZ:** Provides automatic failover in case of an AZ outage.

#### Security Integration
- **IAM Roles:** Define permissions for users and services.
- **VPC Configuration:** Isolate resources and control inbound/outbound traffic.
- **Data Protection:** Use AWS KMS for encryption at rest and in transit.

#### Scalability
- **Auto Scaling Groups:** Automatically scale EC2 instances based on load.
- **Elastic Load Balancer:** Scales to handle varying traffic loads.

#### Performance Monitoring
- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Monitor metrics and set up alarms.
- **AWS Trusted Advisor:** Provides recommendations for performance improvements.

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Infrastructure Setup:** Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to provision resources.
2. **Application Deployment:** Deploy application code to EC2 instances.
3. **Database Configuration:** Set up Amazon RDS with the required schema.
4. **Load Balancer Configuration:** Configure ELB to distribute traffic.
5. **Security Configuration:** Set up IAM roles, security groups, and VPC settings.
6. **Monitoring Setup:** Configure CloudWatch for monitoring and alerts.

### Environment Considerations
- **Production vs Non-Production:** Use separate VPCs and IAM roles for production and non-production environments.
- **Cost Optimization:** Use spot instances and reserved instances in non-production environments to reduce costs.
- **Configuration Differences:** Non-production environments may have lower resource allocations and relaxed security settings.
