1) Solution Summary

The proposed solution aims to provide a robust, scalable, and secure cloud infrastructure for deploying the application within AWS. The key benefits include scalability, cost-effectiveness, improved performance, and enhanced security. The architecture aligns with AWS's six-pillar principles ensuring operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability.

2) Core Functions

The main functionalities of the application include data processing, reporting, and user management. The infrastructure should support high availability, data redundancy, auto-scaling, and secure access control mechanisms.

3) Assumptions/Constraints/Recommendations

Assumptions include high network availability, secure access, and a constant load. Constraints may include budget and compliance requirements. Recommendations include implementing multi-AZ deployment for high availability, using S3 for cost-effective storage, and implementing CloudWatch for performance monitoring.

4) Solution Requirements

4.1) User Access: IAM roles for administrators, developers, and end-users.
4.2) Interfaces: RESTful APIs for communication with other systems.
4.3) Security: Encryption at rest and in transit, secure access control, and regular vulnerability assessments.
4.4) Networking: Required VPC endpoints for secure connectivity.
4.5) Software: EC2 for compute, RDS for database, S3 for storage, and ELB for load balancing.
4.6) Performance: CloudWatch for monitoring and auto-scaling for optimal performance.
4.7) Support: 24/7 support for deployment and ongoing operations.
4.8) Storage & Database: RDS for database needs and S3 for storage. IOPS as per the application requirement.
4.9) Disaster Recovery: Multi-AZ deployment for high availability and quick recovery.
4.10) Compliance & Licensing: Compliance with GDPR and necessary AWS licenses.

5) Proposed Solution

5.1) Current Architecture: The application is currently hosted on on-premises servers.
5.2) Proposed Architecture Details:
The proposed architecture includes EC2 instances for compute, RDS for database, S3 for storage, and ELB for load balancing. The architecture ensures high availability through multi-AZ deployment, security through IAM roles and VPC configurations, and scalability through auto-scaling. Compliance is achieved through encryption and secure access control.
High availability is achieved through multi-AZ deployment and ELB. Security is integrated through IAM roles, VPC configurations, and data protection mechanisms. The architecture is designed to scale based on demand using auto-scaling. Performance will be monitored and optimized using CloudWatch.
Deployment Strategy: The architecture will be deployed using Infrastructure as Code (IAC) using AWS CloudFormation.
Task List: Setting up VPC, IAM roles, EC2 instances, RDS, S3, ELB, and configuring auto-scaling and CloudWatch.
Environment Considerations: Non-production environments can be downscaled to optimize costs. Specific configurations like debug mode can be enabled in non-production environments.
