You are tasked with creating a detailed Cloud Infrastructure Architecture document for deploying the cloud Infra architecture for a application within AWS cloud. The document should cover deployment, governance, and security controls, ensuring alignment with AWS's six-pillar architecture principles: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability.

Note, Ensure that the explanation in the "Proposed Solution" section is detailed enough for technical audiences, including application architects, cloud engineers, DevOps teams, server management teams, and subject matter experts (SMEs). Provide enough context so that each team understands this architecture in details. 

The document should include the below section and each section has the some coments to decide what need to be insluded in that section . Feel free to add the relevent sections or add any new subsection in existing heading if required 

1) Solution Summary

Purpose: Why is this solution needed? What are the key benefits?
Architecture Overview: Provide a brief summary of the proposed architecture and its alignment with AWS principles.
Key Functionality/Capability

2) Core Functions: What are the main functionalities of the application?
Infrastructure Support: What key infrastructure capabilities are required to support these functions?
3) Assumptions/Constraints/Recommendations

Assumptions: What assumptions were made during design?
Constraints: Identify any limitations or constraints of the solution.
Recommendations: Provide recommendations for scalability, security, and performance.

4) Solution Requirements

4.1) User Access: What are the user access requirements? Specify IAM roles needed.
4.2) Interfaces: What systems or APIs will interface with this application?
4.3) Security: What are the key security requirements? Focus on user access and data protection.
4.4) Networking: Specify any required VPC endpoints or connectivity needs.
4.5) Software: List required software components, including databases.
4.6) Performance: Outline performance considerations and monitoring strategies.
4.7) Support: What support is needed for deployment and ongoing operations?
4.8) Storage & Database: What are the storage and database needs? Include key metrics like IOPS.
4.9) Disaster Recovery: What is the DR strategy? Define RPO and RTO.
4.10) Compliance & Licensing: Note any compliance requirements and necessary licenses.

5) Proposed Solution

5.1) Current Architecture: Provide a brief description if applicable.
5.2) Proposed Architecture deatils :
Detailed Description: Provide a comprehensive and detailed description of the proposed architecture. 
Explain how the architecture meets the needs of the application while adhering to AWS's six-pillar principles.
Also include the Component used and how they are being configured for this archietcture. 
Overview: Describe each component involved in the architecture and any other relevant AWS services like IAM  etc. Explain how each component interacts with the others.
Describe why high availability is important for this solution and how it is achieved.Explain how the high availability acheived in this setup if required, including whether it is in built into the AWS services (e.g., EKS, ELB,bedroack, s3 etc ) or configured separately. 
Detail how security is integrated into the architecture, including IAM roles, VPC configurations, and data protection mechanisms. Discuss how the architecture meets any compliance requirements.
Explain how the architecture is designed to scale based on demand.
Explain how performance will be monitored and optimized.
Deployment Strategy: Provide a clear and detailed deployment strategy ans steps which need to be used by engineers to setup, deployment and config. 
Environment Considerations: Describe the differences, if any, between production and non-production environments. Include considerations for cost optimization in non-production environments and any specific configurations that differ from production.
